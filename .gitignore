# Basic Syntax of .gitignore
# Blank Lines: Blank lines are ignored and can be used for readability.

# Comments: Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored by Git. They can be used to explain the purpose of certain rules.

# Ignoring Files and Directories:

# *: Matches any string of characters (including none). For example, *.log ignores all .log files.
# : Matches directories recursively. For example, /temp ignores any temp directory at any level.
# ?: Matches a single character. For example, file?.txt matches file1.txt but not file10.txt.
# [abc]: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets. For example, file[1-3].txt matches file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt.
# Negating Patterns:

# !: Used to negate a pattern. For example, *.log ignores all .log files, but !important.log will include important.log back into tracking.
# Ignoring Specific Directories:

# To ignore a specific directory, you can specify it directly. For example, node_modules/ ignores the node_modules directory.
# Example .gitignore Entries
# *.log: Ignore all log files.
# temp/: Ignore the temp directory.
# !important.log: Do not ignore important.log, even if *.log is specified.
# /build/: Ignore all build directories at any level.
